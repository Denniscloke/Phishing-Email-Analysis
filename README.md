Phishing Email Analysis Dashboard (Excel-Based)

This project is an Excel-based phishing email analysis tool I created to demonstrate my skills in data analysis and cybersecurity. It uses a realistic dataset of email records to identify potentially malicious messages through keyword detection, suspicious domains, and risky attachments.

Project Summary

Phishing is one of the most common cybersecurity threats faced by individuals and organizations. I built this project to simulate how Excel can be used to detect and flag suspicious emails based on multiple risk factors.

The workbook includes:
- A custom dataset of 200 realistic-looking emails  
- A scoring system to evaluate risk level  
- A dashboard with PivotTables and interactive charts  
- Visual breakdowns of risk trends over time

What I Used

- Microsoft Excel (formulas, PivotTables, slicers, and charts)
- Logical functions like `IF`, `SEARCH`, and `ISNUMBER`
- Custom visual dashboard for reporting and trends


Key Features

- Categorizes emails as Low, Medium, or High risk based on their content
- Flags risky keywords (e.g., "password", "urgent", "click here")
- Identifies suspicious senders, domains, and file types
- Dashboard provides an overview of risk levels and email volume over time


Why I Made This

I wanted to show how common office tools like Excel can be used for practical cybersecurity analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with structured data
- Create formulas to automate decisions
- Build visualizations that communicate trends
- Think critically about cybersecurity risks


About Me

I'm interested in cybersecurity, analytics, and operational support roles. This is one of several hands-on projects I've created to build my skills and portfolio.
